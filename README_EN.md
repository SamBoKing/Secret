* Pokemon keeps running.
```
If you move a lot of streets at once from Pokemon Go, you will run for a certain time according to the policy of "soft van"
Pocket stop is not available. It will be available again after a certain period of time. (Please refrain from moving too many streets.)
```
* The current location of the GPS and the location you set are instantly moved.
```
FlyGPS is a program to transfer virtual locations. Therefore, it can not prevent the reception of the actual GPS.
You can reduce this phenomenon by using it in a place where GPS reception is weak, such as a building or a subway that is not affected by GPS.
